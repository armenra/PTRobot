My first programming assignment
Goal: Move all the blocks on the left most stack to the proper positions, blocks of size 1 go to stack one, blocks of size 2 go to stack two and blocks of size 3 are placed on the bars which are between the left most stack and stack one/two

Bars max size: 7

Blocks max size: 3

Bonus: Ensure the blocks are moved to their locations with maximum efficiency
